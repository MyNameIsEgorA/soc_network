Too Much about me so let's get to the project

First of all I'd recommend you to check the mind-map of the projects structure https://www.mindmeister.com/app/map/2922073572. It will make the understandings a lot easier.

The project was started in the middle of August 2023 hopefully it will be finished this year


To start the project make the following commands in your command line:

##npm install 
(installs all the modules)

##npm start
(starts the project)

After you will be redirected to your browser. If not just open the following URL http://localhost:3000/profile in your browser
